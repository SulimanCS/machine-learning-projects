# Project 1: Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Perceptrons
This project aims to train a supervised Machine Learning algorithm with 10 perceptrons over a span of 153 epochs distributed equally between 3 different learning rates. The goal by the end of the training is for the algorithm to identify handwritten digits accurately. The process will be done on two datasets, the first dataset is the training set containing 60000 images for the algorithm to be trained on, and the second is the testing set containing 10000 images for the algorithm to be tested on to ensure that there is no occurrence of the overfitting problem.
