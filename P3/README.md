# Project 3: Naive Bayes classifiers based on Gaussians
This project aims to train a supervised Machine Learning Naive Bayes classifier to predict if a given set of features belong to one of a set of classes P(feature | Class). Due to the simplicity of Naive Bayes classifiers, the accuracy of Naive Bayes classifiers is notably lower in comparison to previous projects.
