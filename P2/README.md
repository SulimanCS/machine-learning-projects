# Project 2: Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Neural Networks
This project aims to train a supervised Machine Learning neural network over two different
experiments. For **experiment #1**, the entire training dataset will be used over three different neural
networks with 20, 50, and 100 hidden units respectively. For **experiment #2**, two neural networks
are created with a fixed number of hidden units (100). However, the two neural networks will be using respectively one-quarter and one-half of the training dataset. In both experiments, the neural networks
will execute techniques such as forward and back propagation to update the weights of its respective network.
After training the neural networks throughout 51 epochs each, accuracy percentages will be
computed by presenting the same training dataset and a test dataset to the networks in-order to
computed prediction correctness over the dataset for the different networks.
