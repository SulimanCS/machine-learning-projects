# Project 4: Handwritten Digit Recognition Using K-Means Clustering
This project aims to train an unsupervised Machine Learning K-Means Clustering algorithm to classify similar handwritten digits into distinct subgroups (clusters). It starts with selecting 10 random cluster centers and uses those cluster centers to join all inputs to the cluster closest to the respective input. After every iteration, the cluster centers are recomputed by computing the means of obtained clusters. The process comes to an end when the set of cluster centers does not change in comparison to the previous iteration.
